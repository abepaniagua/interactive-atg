This is an interactive email for an Instagram account named All Things Grilling. It was built using HTML and CSS.

This is an interactive email built using HTML and CSS with the purpose of having clients use the tabs inside the email to interact with the different options offered. It has 3 tabs with 3 types of information that many email clients can interact with. In the instances that an email client can't render the tabs properly, there is a fallback code which then organizes them vertically and removes the tabs.
